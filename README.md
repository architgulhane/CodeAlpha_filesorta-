# File Organiser

This is a simple Python script that helps you organize files in a folder by their file types. When you run the script, it will ask you for the path to the folder you want to organize. It then creates subfolders for each file type (based on file extension) and moves the files into their respective folders.

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder containing `file_organiser.py`.
3. Run the script with:
   
   ```powershell
   python file_organiser.py
   ```
4. Enter the path of the folder you want to organize when prompted.
5. The script will automatically sort your files into folders by type.

## Example
If you have files like `photo.jpg`, `document.pdf`, and `music.mp3` in your folder, after running the script, you will see folders named `JPG`, `PDF`, and `MP3`, each containing the respective files.

## Note
- The script moves all files in the specified folder into new folders based on their extensions.
- Make sure you have write permissions for the folder you want to organize.
